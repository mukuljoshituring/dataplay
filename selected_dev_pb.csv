PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY 
 
I have a first degree in geography and am currently running an ​MSC Computer Science at​ Georgia​ ​Tech USA  (online) where I 
am specializing in ​Artificial Intelligence and Robotics​. My experience has ranged from an individual software contributor and 
as a technical team lead. Cumulatively,   I have about 8 years of post-qualification experience as a software engineer. I have 
worked with multiple technologies on projects where my role includes building software features, scaling existing legacy 
applications, mentoring junior developers, and ensuring product success.  
 
As a software engineer, I think first about algorithms, data structures,  design, analysis, and architectural patterns when 
solving problems. in a non-language agnostic manner, however, I favor some technological stack over others as defined: 
 
My primary programming language stack is Javascript, I have an excellent understanding of the language features and I am 
proficient in several frameworks and technologies built on top of JavaScript including  ​NodeJS, ReactJS, Angular, Express, 
React Native, Typescript, Jquery,​ and preprocessors and transpilers like ​gulp, rollup, webpack​ and many more. Including unit 
testing tools like​ Jest, Enzyme for React​. I also have decent skills in user interface design and development. And building 
backend services and RESTFUL Apis. 
 
My secondary stack includes python with frameworks built on top of this, including Django, and geospatial and spatial data 
management engines such as ​GDAL, GEOS, and geodjango. ​I also build mobile applications, mainly android using the 
Android Framework on ​Kotlin. I am passionate about Rust programming language and I am learning the technology.

OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS 
 
 
Unified Redux: I  am the author and maintainer of an npm library based on javascript. It is built on top of redux/react and 
seeks to simplify integration of redux concepts into react application, by providing simple and easy configurable steps and 
reducing verbosity to the barest minimum. The wrapper ensures code cohesiveness and functional approach to managing 
state using the redux state engine.  The code is hosted on ​github​. It is at the beta stage however i hope potential users will 
take a crack at it and test it out via ​npm 
 
Jsworkerutils: I authored this library which is based on typescript and written for the browser context. It is built over the 
concept of web workers on the browser  and allows for concurrent parallel calls to optimize and scale user facing 
applications. The code is hosted on ​github​.  And on ​npm 
 
DYGL:  This is a css library to be used by any application that does not want to go through the pains of writing its own css, 
unlike most libraries it is not opinionated and can allow for integration with other css frameworks or library and promises 
smooth integration can be installed via  ​npm

I love developing apps, but I also enjoy other activities. One of my favorite activities is SCUBA diving, and I have experience working as a driving instructor.

I would describe myself as strict and cautious with estimations. I avoid making promises that I cannot deliver. I believe good communication is vital in software development, it saves time, work, and money.

I am adaptable, I've worked on projects as the only developer and projects with large teams. I am looking for interesting and challenging projects.

UpWork ​OCTOBER 2013. – SEPTEMBER 2015. 
ANDROID FREELANCING ENGINEER | REMOTE 
 
●Helped over on 15+ clients to move their software to the next level. I was reviewing 
code, giving suggestions and plugging into existing code to make revisions and finally 
publishing.  
●Making revisions after other developers is always the most challenging, because 
freelancers rarely do a code by SOLID principles. But by doing that, I extracted the best 
code practices and learned on other’s mistakes.  
●Developed in KANBAN, SPRINT & SCRUM setups. 
●Some of the projects I worked on: 
oPlayerFM​ – podcast app 
▪I did my tasks although I was not able to finish all that had been planned. 
The project was too complex, code made by just one coder and I couldn’t 
plug and code fast enough. 
oXpatpub – pub-crawling app for Korean test market 
▪We’ve published it successfully to Google Play Store and I continued 
working on the revisions until the client paused the project indefinitely. 
oConference app for Dubai 
▪The client wanted a completion of 70% finished app on which 4 
freelancers, one after another, worked before they bailed. The code was 
in the worst condition I ever saw and the client had a very tight schedule. 
The client delivered a fully developed app on time.

                                I moved to Infoger to continue the project that was created in Interfoc company, they have sold part of the software for this new
                                company, during two years I was the only developer in the project, my main roles was to provide support and fix bugs, and
                                change the software accordingly to laws. As improvement I worked on tools to make easier to install the software. I have
                                created a new website written in Asp.Net MVC instead of webforms to new customers create an account, the website them
                                was responsible to communicate with postgres and IIS to enable a new instance of the software for customers. Also
                                implemented continuous integration and deploy for the software and also database migrations. I leave the company because
                                the management decided to abandon the software, the revenue was not enough to maintain costs during that time.

                                pages we only used Jquery and some pages we used Knockout.js for data binding. I worked as a full stack developer creating
                                the web pages and also developing the backend logic. The main area that I worked was accounting creating functionalities to
                                calculated taxes, receivables and payables. That time Brazil was introducing eletronic invoice, and them I was responsible for
                                integrate it, I got a lot of knlowledge about those integrations and how to implement.

KimKim's website - (September 2019 - December 2019) E-commerce website for selling 
accessories for shoes
(as freelance)
Role: Front-end developer, one-man-team
 
That's another pixel-perfect website. I really enjoyed working on this project too.  This was developed 
with React too.  If Designing a project and React components was a test then my skills here has well 
performed. I happy also since I have improved existing tools that I had and also added some new 
reusable components to my tool-set. The most challenging part:  1) was re-thinking the architecture of 
the project to make things easier for this and the next project 2)  Developing the product presentation 
page :)

Role: Lead developer, Full-stack developer
 
This is a very ambitions project like Pipedrive, Hubspot or SalesForce. It is a SaaS, enterprise CRM, 
used by international companies. It was started in hard moments. When all my 2 senior devs leaved 
the company I was alone with the CTO and 4 junior developers. Anyway we didn't failed. I did all kind 
of works in this project like a one-man-project plus mentoring juniors to reach productive levels quickly 
and now (4 months after) they are productive. This project has a lot of integrations with external 
services designed for a high load of traffic and high load of data by being carefully designed. I 
developed a framework powered by ReactJS, taking advantage of all React advantages, that has 
increased drastically the development speed. This project was also the prove of 3 things: 1 - even a 
small team can build great products at enterprise levels, 2 - high effort, hard working in years of 
experience and a lot of studying can make people to build great projects with ease and have 
everything under-control, 3 - thinking produces more value than writing code.

I love working on complex projects with positive and smart people around me.

I’ve been involved in challenging projects ranging from hardware abstraction layers, cross-compilers, report generators and distributed systems.

I try to solve problems pragmatically and proactively. When working on a particular project I care about finding efficient and simple solutions. I care about making friendly interfaces that are easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly.

Honors & Awards
Experian Marketing Forward Award (Oct 2015) - Experian
My team won the Experian Marketing Forward Award for our successful, timely delivery on client
obligation projects. The award came from two nominations, quoted below:
 
""The team has been tasked working on various projects with client obligations. Failure in delivery may
mean potentially a penalty to Experian on top of reputation impact. However the team has been doing a
great job. One of the key deliveries is a series of feature enhancements requested by Publishers Clearing
House (PCH) who is one of our top 15 clients. The delivery was so successful which helped the company
engaged with their CMO at stage as testimonial with Experian during client summit as one of the happy
clients. Other deliveries include other top 15 clients such as WSI, Avon, Emirates, Target etc. Great job
done!”
 
""The team has continuously shown their dedication to delivering quality feature enhancements to the
marketing suite platform. Their organization and level of detail in each of their feature designs has
provided extreme value to our clients to help extend the capabilities of the marketing suite. Their ability
to stay on track and hit committed timelines enabled us to fulfill contractual agreements on time. The KL
product managers, development team, and QA team work as one team with one end goal in mind - the
success of our product.”
Experian Marketing Forward Award (Nomination) (Oct 2015) - Experian
I was also nominated for being quick in resolving our clients' urgent, high priority issues, working together
with my US counterparts:
 
""PCH - a flagship client for the Marketing Suite and featured during Client Summit - reported issues with
how fast the Suite was processing web events. We were doing approximately 60k/day and they wanted
1.2m/hour events processed. This was a major issue for PCH. The team turned around a quick response
together to deliver that 1.2m/hour but also the capability of 7 million/hour events processed! That's
12000% improvement! This was truly a cross-functional effort between Product, Development, Client
Services and Ops. It was also a cross-regional effort between folks in North America and KL. The hard
work, quick response and significant improvement in the client experience spoke volumes to PCH about
how well we respond to our first issue with them. Thanks to all team members for making this happen.""
 
""Emirates who is one of our top 15 clients was extremely unhappy with the CCMP platform on multiple
issues including long process on a very unusual complex campaign causing timeout on UI, failure to send
campaign due to unsupported tracking link format as well as claiming lost tracking of revenue due to some
wrong implementation of Google Tag Manager at their system which was clueless at that time. This has
been escalated up to C-level. The team has worked very hard every day and night, found out the real root
cause, explained the issue, provided workaround and eventually fixed them permanently which had not
just benefited Emirates but also all clients in general within very short time. This has successfully helped
the business with our very important client and made a direct impact to our business. Well done!""

Experian Marketing Forward Award (Apr 2015) - Experian
Together with other team members, we won the Marketing Forward Award for closing high-priority
security vulnerability issues to win an important deal from Citi, while also successfully delivering our
scheduled major release at the same time!
 
The nomination is quoted below:
 
""A key to winning the Citi deal was the completion of several iterations of a vulnerability assessment
against the CCM platform. This was time sensitive and also came at a time when the Carbon release was to
be delivered - a major release that included several client commitments. Ultimately, the team delivered the
Citi vulnerability assessment, associated fixes, and delivered Carbon in parallel. Ultimately, the quick and
accurate response of Dev, Ops, Agile Office, and Program Management led to the signing of a major deal
for CCM. Led by Victoria and Jared from the US, a number of team members rallied and responded. The
effort also resulted in further security hardening and improvements to CCMP, benefiting all of our clients.
The team demonstrated yet another proof of Global Software Development in action - moving quickly,
with accuracy and resulting in business value - in this case a new sale!""
Experian Marketing Forward Award (Oct 2014) - Experian
I was a key contributor recognized in resolving production issues with high-quality fixes. There were
severe issues that could bring huge impacts to our data, our business and our clients. I raised concerns to
the respective parties, proposed the best solutions and implement them in time.
 
In addition, my passion and effort on our hackday idea from inception on Day 1, winning the hackday
competition, presenting it to product team discussion, to developing a working prototype for demo in our
Client Summit within a short time left a profound impression on others.
 
My focus and commitment to achieve ultimate results is being seen as an exemplary model for the team.
 
The nomination is quoted below:
 
""Eng Chin has been playing an important role in the CCM BAU team, especially during the Brown Shoe
task force period, Eng Chin plays a key contributor in resolving many non-Brown Shoe issues, despite
tight scheduled, he has achieved many high-quality bug resolution in a timely manner, BAU would not
have been successful for the past few releases without his involvement and contribution. He always
proactively proposed and raised concerns on important issues, thus reduce further damage to production
database. For instance, he has raised concern on one of the Veracode issues which may seriously damage
the data integrity in the admin database which could not be repaired. He has participated the Hackday
idea and won the first prize in the event, he is one of the key members in this initiative, this idea was highly
recognized by the product team, a completed Foursquare POC has been developed and presented in the
product team discussion board. He has shown his focus and commitment in order to achieve the ultimate
result and he is a certainly exemplary model that I would like to award and promote to the team in KL.""
Experian Spot Award (Jun 2014) - Experian Cheetahmail
During my time working on BAU, there were a number of issues that require high amount of effort to
be resolved. A few issues were very severe that could impact our organization. I voiced out the issues,
conducted research, proposed solutions and completed implementations to resolve the issues within
short time frame.

My peers and I formed a team of five to develop a new social network integration feature with the Cross

almost 20 teams from the KL development center. We managed to pitch the idea with demo to three
judges from different business lines and emerge as the winner.

Experian Spot Award (Sep 2013) - Experian Cheetahmail
The award was given to recognize my knowledge, guidance and effort in the internationalization and
localization projects for the Cross Channel Marketing platform, particularly for the Segmentation module
where I spent the most effort to solve complex logic problem.
Experian Hackday 2013 - Kuala Lumpur - Winner - Experian
Spam and phishing messages can be embedded in images and sent out to the public. In an effort to prevent
these malicious emails from being sent out and affect our email platform deliverability, we developed a
feature using OCR and AI technology to scan and detect these embedded messages. The use of technology
combined with the potential return of investment to business won us the Hackday 2013 first prize.

At first, I have experienced Android & iOS projects for 4 years. Then I have attended to build some big web sites and I have experienced of working in web field such as PHP, Laravel, Java, JavaScript, Node.js, Python for 5+ years. I already have completed more than 30 projects related to React, Laravel, Python, JavaScript, Shopify, Magento, Wordpress, Android, Swift, React Native. I attended Pluralsight course for ""Lessons from Real World Code Reviews"" (http://bit.ly/dncm29-ps-course). I have been appling what I learned from Shawn Wildermuth to the real projects so far. - code standards, unit tests are a key step for improving code quality - Sometimes I need Automated Software for analyzing code and flags suspect code that doesn't follow guidelines or has other potential issues. - Pull Request, Tools like GitHub allow us to review codes and comment on it before it's merged. As a senior full stack developer, I have made the structure/system for React/CSS/PHP code reviews with the knowledge I experienced from My favorite mentor Shawn Wildermuth. During my React/TypeScript/PHP/.NET Core/Angular development, what I keep in mind is the ""1 to M"" rule which is, ""Code is written once but read many times."" This means that fancy or tricky coding should be avoided. If you can't figure out what the code is doing by reading it, it wasn't written well. I have also much experience on blockchain/DdApp/Ethereum/Smart contracts/Solidity. Before starting any project, I discuss all necessary details and suggest any additional steps, so the final product matches the customer idea, while not missing out on further improvements from a rich past experience. My customers are always kept up-to-date during the development process and are sure to be happy with the results. Furthermore, I also provide any documentation and instructions necessary, to prevent vendor lock-in. Typical Projects DriverMagic(React/ASP.NET) 2019 My client Robert and Justin wanted me to build React/TypeScript UI for their ASP.NET project. This project includes APS.NET WinForms/Core API and FrontEnd UI (React/TypeScript/Sass) I recommended React/TypeScript UI based on CefSharp of .NET During building React UI, I and Robert always focused on StoryBook and Enzyme for safe code, full unit test and expendable codes. This development attitude and habit was one of my best pride. ASP.NET Core 2.1 API for supporting updates of the latest computer drivers. UI with React.js 16 + TypeScript3 Integrated UI via CefSharp framework with OwinFileHost. GraphQL REST API for latest driver information, rollback, alternative management. Used Docker, Docker machine, Docke compose for Continuous Integration, Delivery & Deployment (CI/CD) Introducing CefSharp to build UI for Driver managment desktop application reduced the speed of UI development by 2 months. SoftMatter 2018 SoftMatter was a really good experience for my web developer career (ReactJS + .NET Core) My clients wanted me to create .NET Core API for supporting updates of the latest computer drivers. First I built UI with React.js 16 + TypeScript3. And I integrated it via CefSharp framework by OwinFileHost. Then I made Windows Forms to manage main UI outline including React UI webkit control box. At third stage, I built GraphQL REST API for latest driver information, rollback, alternative management... Driver management requires keyboard, mouse detect and other system devices detect in run-time base. I registered this app as Windows Services and check periodically network status with firewall rules. Finally I deployed it at Azure I used Docker, Docker machine, Docke compose for Continuous Integration, Delivery & Deployment (CI/CD) My clients emphasized Unit Test structure so that I used Jest/Enzyme and Storybook for React You can see how I build UI/Main SDK/API part from source code and how I run as service via teamviewer. I think this project concept and source code will greatly help any other projects. Main advantages from this project and my experience are: - React+TypeScript+SASS UI - .NET Core 2.x API - Test Framework (StoryBook, Jest, Enzyme) I can resue all libraries and source codes for future projects and it will grealy reduce time and cost. the IT lead were really satisfied about my ability to solve any challenges in the real world during the interview. So I am quite sure I can show my ability during an interview. At that time, he required me to do online coding test and for an 1 hour, I passed all unit tests of online coding. Qsr Automation (Node/GraphQL/React/TypeScript) 2017 My client wanted me to build React.js 16.1 + TypeScript 3.4 for UI of front end with fantasy football analytics app. FE functionality included being able to accept a file, send the file to the server, run shell script on server with the file as argument. Shell script generated a new file and the server should return this file to the client where it was downloaded. I made Node.js GraphQL API. At that time I deployed it at AWS. If you want, I can deploy it as AWS lambda function (Serverless framework) Then I analysed ingridients for clients sent by REST API and generated the files of analysing results. The users of site can download these files. Main advantages from this project and my experience are: - React.js + TypeScript + Sass - Node.js / AWS Cloud Service / Lambda function - File generation libraries like jsPDF, FPDI Ticket Tailor (React/Redux Saga) 2016 This site was for ticketing their events. My clients wanted me to make features as a ticketing platform for events of all sizes. My role was: - Frontend features with React JS 16, Redux Saga - Upgrade site by Spring Boot 2.1.4 - Reconstruct models to speed up by Hibernate 5.2 - Gitlab code management - AWS VPS/Lambda/S3/SQS/API Gateway configuration - Deploy by Docker compose, docker machine I have been always satisfying my client with the punctual delivery and the best quality.

The greatest day in my life is when I take total responsibility for my attitudes. That's the day I truly grow up. So I always try to grow up a little bit daily. Reading books, listening TED talks, attending conferences at least once a week. It's my greatest hobby and interest. Failing Forward Attitude In life, the question is not if we will have problems, but how we are going to deal with our problems. What I think every time I start a new project - Fail early, fail often, but always fail forward.

Skills 
Experience 
•
Leading a team of 4 members and 2 Android apps at Jirah, the Jirah Sitter app and the Jirah Parent app. 
•
Brought a clean codebase into existence by using MVVM and the latest libraries such as Kotlin Coroutines, Dagger2, Retrofit2, Android 
Navigation Component, Work Manager, Room, View Model, LiveData, Android Paging and other Android JetPack libraries. 
•
Delivered the Jirah Sitter app, from inception to deployment in under 6 months so the Jirah Sitter Android app is my baby! 
•
Quickly took over the Jirah Parent app after finishing the Jirah Sitter app, the app was unstable and janky, fixed all the main bugs and 
improved its UI rendering performance and eliminated all UI janks in under 1 month. 
•
Streamlined deployment process by setting up an automatic build &deployment pipeline using Bitbucket Pipeline and Google Play API. 
•
Wrote a custom Chat SDK using SendBird SDK and published it as a private repo, now used by both Android apps for chat functionality. 
•
Quickly took over the Unified Remote Android and iOS apps which were already written and had a very large user base (1M+). 
•
Actively worked closely with old developers for effective transfer of the domain knowledge from them to me and also worked closely 
with the clients to define the goals and milestones. 
•
At a very rapid pace, upgraded the app’s aging codebase from min API 9 to 14 to take advantage of newer APIs and removed 
duplicated and dead code, all in under 3 months.  
•
Got rid of UI janks due to slow rendering by using GPU and memory profilers to locate code blocks causing them and optimized them 
to bring the frame rendering time and memory usage under Android Vitals limits. Greatly reduced live image rendering time by at least 
3x by moving bitmap uploading to GPU in a background thread and by moving memory allocations out of the canvas drawing pass. 
•
Delivered the Chat Sports Android app, from inception to development to deployment in less than 1 year. During this period actively 
worked closely with the designers to validate designs and backend developers to finalise the API endpoints and their responses. 
•
Successfully deployed the app and actively participated in brainstorming and validating new features after the app release. 
•
Worked as a member of the team working on the HeyA dating app and contributed to real-time chat, user profile, onboarding flows. 
•
After the app’s release, actively worked on its maintenance and improvements including image downloading optimization. 
Projects 
MDacne                                
•
Quickly refactored the critical components of the MDacne app to make them stable in under 1 week and then added social features like 
posting recovery progress to the MDacne community, deleting posts and analyzing your skin differences in side by side comparisons. 
•
Wrote the selfies upload and sync feature by communicating closely with the backend developer to get the APIs ready first and added 
Google Sign In/Up as an alternative onboarding option. Also, guided junior developers in writing clean code that follows MVVM. 
SKEDit App                                
•
Took over the SKEDit app with an existing, unstable and underperforming codebase at a very rapid pace and worked closely with the 
old developer for smooth and quick transfer of the domain knowledge. 
•
Moved all the duplicated code into relevant repositories to make sure the code is centralized and adheres to the MVP architecture. 
•
Improved the main screen load and rendering time by 4x by separating the unnecessary bundling of 5 tabs and data load on UI. 
Vonnue Analytics SDK                                
•
Developed an Analytics SDK for Android and deployed it as a private Maven repo all in just 1 week, exceeding all client expectations. 
SDK supports automatic screen views and global app events collection as well as custom events combined with a user's identity. 
•
Used Kotlin Coroutines for an effective asynchronous logic and Kotlin Flow to manage the stream of events. Also used events buffering 
for backpressure management. 
•
Wrote a sophisticated events uploading logic by using 2 adaptive event uploaders, one for uploading important events immediately 
when the app is in the foreground, the other for uploading remaining events in the background.

Shane Devane 
Django/Python Developer 
 
OVERVIEW 
I am a software developer with a career spanning 20 years. I’ve been in some 
interesting startups, traveled the world a bit and have spent most of my 
career working directly with founders and engineering teams to deliver 
Product. The first half of my career I worked with a wide variety of .NET 
technologies, since 2016, I have been slowly pulled more towards Product and 
became the go between Product and Engineering. For 2020, I want to refocus 
on a hands-on engineering role again.

► Took over and led the delivery of a 12 month project and delivered. 
► Led a company wide data and metrics project tracking product metrics. 
 
Reason for leaving: ​Blerter has had a 10 year struggle for product/solution fit.

JAVA ENGINEER + TECHNICAL PRODUCT OWNER -​ ​PLYNK  
www.plynk.me (offline) 
April 2017 - January 2018, Dublin, Ireland. 
Plynk was a P2P social money messenger app that raised €25M Series A. 
I was one of the first employees and worked with the CEO and CTO to develop

► Led engineering team, code craftsmanship principles and CI/CD practices 
► Launched 1 app localized for Ireland, Portugal and India  
► Built a feedback community with 12,000 student users 
 
Reason for leaving: ​Plynk went bankrupt after claiming a $25M Series A that 
never existed. It was an interesting time! There was lots of drama. I joined as I 
knew the CTO and founding team. I didn’t know the new CEO too well. 
 
PYTHON DEVELOPER + CO-FOUNDER -​ ​NEWSLINN  
www.newslinn.com (offline) 
June 2015 - April 2017, Dublin, Ireland. 
Newslinn was a citizen-to-journalist photo sharing app seed funded by Google. 
I developed the technology stack using Python, ReactJs, React-Native, Django, 
Celery, Boto, Redis, EC2, S3, Nodejs, socket.io, Mongodb, vagrant, PyKE, docker,

► Spoke at European Journalist Centres’ Summits in Berlin, Hamburg, Dublin 
► Finalist in Google Adopt a Startup 
 
Reason for leaving:​ Newslinn was great, but it was in a declining industry that 
has little investor interest. Towards the end of our runway I weighed up the 
options of freelancing to extend the runway instead I bit the bullet and joined 
Plynk, potentially as their Head of Technology.  
 
TECHNICAL LEAD + SCRUMMASTER - ​WONGA 
www.wonga.com 
July 2012 – April 2016, Dublin, Ireland and Cape Town, South Africa. 
Wonga is a world-recognized name in online loans. 
As a technical lead, I was responsible for a team of 18 based in Cape Town and 
leading the team to port the UK platform to ZA. I took on everything day to day 
and worked on coding, mentoring, hiring, training, scrum, agile and product 
development. I worked closely with the PO, management, customer service, 
marketing and liaising with all technical teams (QA, BI, Risk, Security, 
Performance) in Dublin, London, Kiev, and Cape Town.  
► Worked with 5 POs across 9 different financial products. 
► One of 7 out of 300 engineers selected to lead a country product team.

production every second week. 
► Projects: PayLater, Short Term Loans UK, Short Term Loans ZA, Instalment 
Loans ZA. FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) requirements for UK/ZA. 
 
Reason for leaving:​ Wonga was a payday loan lender and commercial line of 
credit with big ambitions to create a global credit platform and invest in 
startups. Wonga struggled to build profitable products outside of their payday 
loan product and the UK FDA changed regulations that led to bankruptcy. 
300+ engineers from their Dublin/London office were made redundant.

Profile
I am a technologist at heart, and that means always keeping pace with bleeding edge 
technologies. I have over 12 years of working experience in startups, corporations 
and entrepreneurship. I fell in love with the fancy cyber world in early 2000, and since 
then started an amazing journey in the digital universe. 
Since 2007, I have been working as a freelancer, contractor, advisor, co-founding 
startups, lead engineer and CTO. I have ample experience in managing tech teams 
as well, often in the position of lead tech (technology-oriented) or team manager 
(people-oriented). 
I also have dabbled in distributed messaging systems, peer-to-peer technology, live 
video streaming and writing high performance framework from scratch. With wide 
variety of projects I have successfully delivered in the past, I will be your best bet to 
take it from concept to reality.

exercises using GPS data & step counts. Leveraging the power of IoT and big 
data with Apache Kafka, Apache Ignite & Spark to analyze user#s  running routes 
for different purposes such as advertising, rewards and game events. The REST 
API of the app is deploy on AWS Fargate to run containers serverlessly
•Lead a small team to develop a Grab like mobile app which allows public users to 
post their re%uest on various religious services, service providers will then bid 
for the latest re%uest with a base cost (per km) charged based on the route to 
the user#s venue. Users can chat with service providers in real time to coordinate 
the successful bid re%uest. The app also aggregates news from different social 
feeds, and publicizes places of worship, and various charity funds where users 
can donate via payment gateway.
•Develop a Tinder like app for Muslim which re%uires approval from parents 
of both sides. Every sign up needs a link to her/his parent via an OTP code. 
Users are re%uired to record boomerang (short video clip) during registration 
and this is then converted into an animated proZle picture which is used on the 
ProZle card. All 4 parties (couple + 2 parents) can then join in a chat once they 
successfully matched.
•Lead a small team to develop an eCommerce app for SESO Malaysia (NGO)  to 
combat food waste. Merchants can upload their products in the backend and set 
discounts for their desirable time frame to %uickly sell off their goods that are 
expiring soon. Users can search products by location, cuisine, merchant name 
and various Zlters to purchase their meals for the day. Users would then collect 
from the store by scanning a QR code of the order after the purchase via online 
payment gateway.
R&D and MVPs:
•Research and develop a working prototype for a security Zrm where users can 
trigger a SOS alert from their phone with real time video live stream to the 
security center. Personnels in the security center can monitor the whereabouts 
of the user and react to the stress call by answering the video stream call. 
Security Zrms use the desktop Electron app to communicate with the user on 
mobile app via WebRTC. Faces detected in the video that are not the user will 
be recorded in the system as threat suspect. The system leverages the power 
of IoT and Machine Learning with Apache Pulsar, Kotlin and Tensorqow
•Research and develop a MVP (minimum viable product) for a face recognition 
entry system designed to work with various live video feeds such as desktop 
connected Webcams, CCTV, IP-cam,  mobile tablets, and encased Android 
devices. The same system works as an automated CCTV monitoring system 
allowing employers to track the amount of people in the shop both live and 
historical data. 
•A timeframe is conZgurable to help ofZces to monitor break-ins where a short 
video clip will be recorded if any human is detected within that particular 
duration. The system is designed as a few different pluggable share-nothing 
modules for horizontal scalability and had been stress tested to support more 
CCTV feeds on a single machine or multiple nodes. Kotlin, Golang, Tensorqow, 
Apache Pulsar, Apache Ignite are being used in the project and have been 
through Zne tuning to achieve lower latency.

•Design and build a mobile app that live streams real time video feed to transform 
the phone#s camera into a CCTV. Users could use multiple phones to view the 
streaming phone and get notiZcation alerts when the camera detected a human. 
A short video clip will also be recorded when the detection occurs. Users can 
also talk to the CCTV phone to give out warning in loudspeaker mode or simply 
set a MP3 as alarm sound. All videos, images and data of the detection are also 
stored in the Cloud for backup and historical reports.

 ",10/26/2020 13:36,,3.0,,LinkedIn.com/in/julianhulme,,,"I am a software developer with over 6 years of experience with Mobile (largely iOS) and 5 years with Full Stack Backend technologies such as Django, Python, Java, PostgreSQL, NGINX, and Ubuntu. 

When I develop, I like to consider how the business requirements and user experience can be seamlessly put together for a rewarding outcome for both the business and the end-users. 

I've worked in various software companies in South Africa as well as in other places in the world. I'm proud to have been able to keep learning throughout my career by having received great opportunities. I also have experience working in corporate environments, reporting either to a tech lead or a CTO. 

I enjoy working with data and feel that data is the strongest way to make product design decisions. I am eager to work with applied AI and data science if possible. I truly believe being agile is important and having managed clients myself as a remote developer for 3 years, I understand the value of empathy and communication.",3.0,5/6/2020 21:33,,1020000.0,7/16/2020 16:29,ZAR,96030.346,200.0,0.0,False,False,True,7/21/2020 7:32,57.0,8/27/2020 14:50,False,200.0,True,,,31950.0,427108.0,Full Stack Web Developer/Product Manager,ARCADE ai,2017.0,April,2020.0,February,,,,,2/5/2021 11:43,2/5/2021 11:43,7087.0,427108.0,5981.0,2012.0,2/5/2021 11:44,2/5/2021 11:44,16342.0,427108.0,Bachelors Of Science in Computer Science,University Of Cape Town,2005.0,January,2008.0,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Past & Current Projects 
• Snap-to-Road – This  is  a  fundamental microservice in  Grab  geographical  systems  to  accurately 
position drivers. It’s built with Go language & Redis as the data store. Known as “map matching” in 
the  research  community, our  approach uses the  hidden Markov model.  Initial  implementation  is 
adapted from the paper “Hidden Markov Map Matching Through Noise & Sparseness”. As the initial 
author  of  Snap-to-Road V3, I’m involved in the initiation & planning phase and has successfully 
brought it to production. V3 has novel aspects not documented in the paper that enables real-time 
snapping that will be documented in a patent  pending submission where I’m also one of the core 
authors. I also helped to reduce infra costs by means of code optimization (e.g. making use of Sync 
Pool) and revising ASG policies via terraform. 
• Multi-modal  route  planner – This is  a  microservice  to  suggest  best  routing  plan  across  various 
modalities,  e.g.  Trains,  Buses  and  Grab  rides. Initial  implementation  is  adapted  from  the  paper 
“Connection Scan Algorithm”. The service is a joint-work with a fellow team member.  
• Grab for Business – Consists of a web portal, admin portal, revamp of Grab’s passenger app & 
various other integration work with the rest of Grab internal system. The system as a whole allows 
businesses  to  manage  ride  policies,  payment  methods & employees. Employees  of  enrolled 
businesses will be able to take corporate rides in accordance to the company’s pre-set policies. 
• Grab  Dispatcher – This  is one  of  the major  backend systems used  in  Grab  that  handles  the 
sending/receiving  of  messages  to/from  driver  such  as  a  job  broadcast  to  driver & handling  of 
bidding/cancelling etc. It broadcast jobs to driver using a persistent TCP connection to the driver. It 
is written using node.js. It initially uses the async library for control flow. I worked on the transition to 
use node-sync. I also worked on the separation of dispatcher into communication layer & logic layer 
to achieve graceful restart that avoids the disconnection of every driver during every deployment. 
• Rotation-invariant License Plate Detector (final year project) – This is a license plate detector 
developed with Pedro F. Felzenszwalb & Daniel P. Huttenlocher's graph-based image segmentation 
algorithm (their algorithm is open source but I have to port it over to use OpenCV). It uses variance-
based features & is integrated with libsvm. It is written in C++ with OpenCV. The algorithm does not 
achieve groundbreaking results compared to existing solutions, but it was a novel method & provides 
the basis for future Computer-Vision related research.)

FREELANCE
Weatherback
Here I designed an openGL particle system to build amazing weather effects like rain, dust,
snow, stars.
Advanced obfuscation
A private library which generate a a lot of random dummy logic at compile time(annotation
processor). The logic can call each other apis. Generated logic include also android
components(inobfuscable elements like activities, services, reciviers, etc...) and of course
such elements were injected in compiled android manifest file. In linkage with proguard  and
randomized obfuscation keys each release build can differ substantially. 
Library scope was to complicate reverse engineering.

ANDROID DEVELOPER – Noction
A social network startup application from scratch. The project was frozen for an undefined
time. It was published on beginning of 2020 and can be found 
here. 
Here we used MVVM architecture and divided the project in separate gradle modules(for
scalability and low compile time). With platform independent main module(thanks to kotlin
multiplatofm)  we obtain the advantage to share use cases to ios, web, desktop apps.

I'm a perfectionist by nature, and for as long as I can remember, I was an enthusiast in technology, as my father was also a System Analyst. I was always playing around with electronics, pc hardware, video and sound edition, and web development.

I started professionally as a print and web designer until I fell in love with coding... and never looked back. Nowadays I like to have both technical and visual skills on layouts and mockups.

In my spare time, I like to stay up to date with technologies and keep an eye on emergent ones.

As a hobby, I love going out on a motorcycle ride to relax, play videogames, and spend time with my family.",4.0,8/30/2020 15:00,,320000.0,8/30/2020 15:48,BRL,55640.872,30.0,2.0,False,False,False,10/21/2020 15:41,57.0,10/19/2020 9:17,True,30.0,True,,,50801.0,451983.0,Senior Web Engineer,BairesDev,2017.0,September,2020.0,October,,,,,2/5/2021 11:43,2/5/2021 11:43,,,,,,,24125.0,451983.0,BS in System Analysis,Estácio de Sá University,2012.0,January,2016.0,January,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Web Developer
VMware Armenia
I have worked in vROps which is a web-based monitoring application for vCenter servers. The application is based
on Java with ExtJS web UI.
I have worked on a tool here to bundle ExtJS scripts in order to optimize script loading and I have optimized it for
6+ times for some network connections (tested on DSL network connection). I was using NodeJS and Gulp for that
tool. And in the research process, I also investigated Grunt and Webpack.
I also have worked with Angular 5+ for some separate pages and mocks and also I have worked on an idea of
partial Angular integration to that old platform which will help the company to step by step move to Angular.
JavaScript Instructor
ACA
During this classes, I taught JavaScript starting from ES5 and covering the most part of ES6. I had taught them also
basics of NodeJS and we did some projects with NodeJS and pure JavaScript.
Angular Lead
Cerberus
I was working there as the leader of the development team. I have worked on several projects basically with
Angular and NodeJS. In the beginning, I was helping the team to fix up some of their old projects and later, we had
some projects with Angular 5 and NodeJS one of which were a landing page with Angular Universal, Vimeo, and
Eventbrite integrations and the other one was a website for selling pets online with its admin application for
managing content. In the last one, we were also using PostgreSQL and we have had scheduler-programs, mixed
rendering, and data scrappers from XML and a web link.
Angular Instructor
ACA
I was teaching the basics of ECMAScript 5 and went deeper into its nuances. Then I was introducing them into
ES6, native DOM, jQuery as a historical tool, TypeScript, RxJS. And then I was teaching the basics and
fundamentals of the Angular platform. And at the end, we were working on some projects with Angular.
Software Developer
